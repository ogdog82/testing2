Introduction
This design document outlines the framework for a 2D RPG that embraces roguelike elements by combining auto-attacking mechanics with manual skill usage, robust procedural dungeon generation, and a focus on long-term progression. The goal is to create an experience that rewards both strategic planning and quick in-combat decisions while offering infinite replayability.

Game Overview
Genre & Style: A 2D roguelike RPG with dungeon-crawling focus. The art style is envisioned as pixel art or hand-drawn animation, with dark yet vibrant color palettes suited for a mystery-filled dungeon environment.

Core Features:

Auto-Attacking: Seamless basic attacks.

Manual Skill Usage: Player-driven abilities with cooldown management and resource costs.

Robust Dungeon Generation: Randomly generated levels that feature traps, puzzles, and environmental storytelling.

Progression Focus: Persistent character upgrade system, skill trees, and gear evolution across runs.

Roguelike Elements: Permanent death (or “roguelite” adaptations), ensuring each run feels fresh and challenging.

The game is designed to balance spontaneous tactical combat with long-term growth systems so that players feel both immediacy in battle and satisfaction in gradual progression.

Game Mechanics
Combat System
Auto-Attacking:

Mechanism: The core combat loop automatically triggers basic attacks on nearby or targeted enemies. These auto-attacks have a fixed rate that can be enhanced via character upgrades or gear modifications.

Feedback: Visual and sound effects will reinforce every successful hit. The system supports combo counters and chaining bonuses if conditions are met.

Considerations: Fine-tuning the auto-attack rate versus skill cooldown balance is critical, as it will directly impact the pacing and feel of combat.

Skill Usage (Manual Skills):

Mechanism: Players can activate special skills which have unique effects such as area damage, buffs, debuffs, or crowd control. Skills are mapped to hotkeys and on-screen buttons.

Resource Management: Each skill will require a resource (mana, energy, or stamina) and have a cooldown period to prevent overuse.

Skill Variations: Include targeted skills, area of effect abilities, and self-buffs. Skills can be upgraded and diversified through skill trees and equipment.

Balancing: Every ability should provide a meaningful trade-off—high damage skills with long cooldowns or rapid, low-damage skills with positioning requirements.

Dungeon Generation
Algorithm and Structure:

Procedural Generation: Use randomized algorithms to craft dungeons that offer non-linear layouts. The generation system should incorporate multiple biomes or themes, ensuring consistency in challenge scaling.

Room Types: Each dungeon consists of a variety of room types: combat arenas, puzzle chambers, treasure rooms, trap corridors, and mini-boss arenas.

Connectivity: Ensure that generated levels are interconnected logically, with branching paths and secret rooms that reward exploration.

Replayability: Design parameters to adjust difficulty and rewards, making repeated playthroughs challenging and unpredictable.

Technical Considerations: Incorporate modular assets and prefabs for ease of level design, aiming to reduce repetition while maintaining thematic unity.

Progression and Character Growth
Experience and Leveling:

System: Players gain XP from combat, exploration, and puzzle solving. Levels unlock new skills, stat points, or special abilities.

Skill Trees: Branching trees that allow customized builds focusing on offense, defense, magic, or hybrid classes.

Gear and Upgrades:

Random Loot: Dungeons reward players with gear that offers unique modifiers. Items range in rarity, providing a progression curve from basic to legendary.

Upgrade Paths: Equipment can be enchanted or upgraded using in-game resources. Choices here influence both auto-attack efficiency and manual skill potency.

Persistent Progression: Implement a meta-progression system, such as unlockable classes or permanent stat boosts, which persist across dungeon runs even if the character dies.

Risk vs. Reward:

Mechanics: Incorporate risk elements (e.g., increased difficulty in deeper levels) balanced by greater rewards, encouraging strategic decision-making on when to push forward or retreat if possible.

User Interface (UI)
HUD (Heads-Up Display)
Core Components:

Health and Resource Bars: Display current health points and resource (mana/energy/stamina) for skill usage.

Auto-Attack Indicator: A subtle timer or progress bar indicating the auto-attack rate and combo buildup.

Cooldown Timers: Icons for manual abilities showing cooldown duration and availability.

Responsive Feedback:

Effects: Visual pops and numerical feedback (damage dealt, healing effects) should occur for both auto-attacks and skills.

Positional Flexibility: Ensure UI adapts to various screen sizes and can be optionally toggled or scaled.

Menu Systems
Inventory/Equipment Screen:

Design: A grid or list-based system displaying equipped items, loot, and character stats. Sorting and filtering options help streamline resource management.

Skill Tree and Upgrade Menus:

Navigation: Easily navigable, perhaps employing a radial layout or branching tree visualization. Each node should include detailed descriptions and costs.

Map and Dungeon Navigation:

Minimap: An overlay featuring the current room layout, key points of interest, and discovered secret areas.

Dungeon Map Screen: A larger, toggleable map that shows the entirety of the current run’s layout, including missed paths and potential hints.

Settings and Accessibility:

Options: Colorblind modes, control remapping, audio adjustments, and gameplay difficulty toggles.

Overall Structure and World Design
World Structure
Run-Based Model:

Session Flow: Each play session consists of one dungeon run—starting at an entry point, progressing through various randomized levels, and culminating in a boss area with the potential for rare drops or unlockable content.

Return Hub: Between runs, players access a persistent hub (town or fortress) where they upgrade their skills, manage inventory, and receive narrative fragments that build the lore.

Narrative and Theming
Lore Integration:

Environmental Storytelling: Use item descriptions, environmental clues, and NPC tidbits to develop the world’s lore within the context of dungeon crawling.

Branching Storylines: Encourage exploration with side quests and lore-based puzzles that reward players with unique enhancements or story revelations.

Technical Flow
Main Game Loop:

Start/Hub: The persistent base where progression and upgrades are managed.

Dungeon Entry: Transition into a randomly generated dungeon.

Exploration and Combat: Deep dive into rooms featuring auto-attacks, manual skills, and dynamic environmental challenges.

Boss Encounter: Culminates each dungeon session with a significant battle that tests learned mechanics.

Run Conclusion: Conclude with victory rewards or game over, then revert to the hub for meta-progression choices.

Game States:

Paused State: Access for inventory, menus, or settings.

Combat State: Real-time decision making with responsive auto-attacks and manual input.

Exploration State: Lower pace exploration allowing for environmental interaction and puzzle solving.

Systems Integration and Flow
Input Management:

Controls: Responsive keyboard/mouse or gamepad support, ensuring smooth transitions between auto-attacking and manual skill activation.

AI and Enemy Behavior:

Enemy Design: Use AI patterns that require players to adapt between passive auto-attacks and triggered manual engagements. Enemies have states (idle, alert, aggressive) that influence how they respond during a dungeon run.

Audio Design and Feedback:

Sound Effects: Craft distinct audio cues for auto-attacks, skills, and environmental interactions.

Music: Adaptive soundtracks based on dungeon areas to heighten immersion.

Save and Meta-Progression Systems:

Persistence: Despite the roguelike challenge, incorporate aspects of the character’s journey—unlocked skills, gear recipes, or permanent stat enhancements—to reward persistence.

Monetization and Additional Systems
Monetization Approach:

Cosmetic Options: Offer skins, avatar customizations, or cosmetic effects that do not affect gameplay balance.

Expansion Packs: Regularly introduce new dungeon themes or skill classes as optional paid expansions.

In-Game Economy: An economy based on in-dungeon currency and meta-hub rewards to purchase consumables, temporary boosters, or trade gear.

Social and Leaderboards:

Competitive Metrics: Timed runs, highest scores, or special challenge modes that integrate online leaderboards, encouraging community competition without compromising the game’s core progression mechanics.
